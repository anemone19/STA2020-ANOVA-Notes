All factors/variables that are investigated, controlled, manipulated, thought to influence the response, are called the treatment factors. They become the **explanatory variables** (mostly categorical) in the model. For each treatment factor, we actively choose a set of **levels**. For example, the treatment factor \"temperature\" can have levels 10, 20, and 50°C. If temperature is the only treatment factor in the experiment, the **treatments**[^02_expdesign_term-1] will also be 10, 20, and 50°C.\n\n[^02_expdesign_term-1]: The terminology of treatments can be traced back to 1920's when it was first applied by Ronald Fisher in the agricultural sciences. He is often refered to as the Founder of Statistics! Have a look at the very first application of ANOVA [here](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-agricultural-science/article/abs/studies-in-crop-variation-i-an-examination-of-the-yield-of-dressed-grain-from-broadbalk/882CB236D1EC608B1A6C74CA96F82CC3) and also a very [nice article](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2245989) describng the history of statistics and his contribution to the field.\n\nIf we manipulate more than one factor (e.g., temperature and pressure), we have two treatment factors. When several treatment factors are manipulated, the experiment is called factorial and the **treatments** are all possible combinations of the factor levels. If we have pressure levels \"low\" and \"high,\" there are 6 treatments in total:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Visualization of how treatments are formed as combinations of treatment levels. ](02_ExpDesign_Term_files/figure-html/fig-vistreat-1.png){#fig-vistreat width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the figure above, there are two treatment factors: Temperature (on the y-axis) and Pressure (on the x-axis). The axis ticks represent the levels of each treatment factor, and the blocks within the grid represent the treatments, which are specific combinations of the levels of Temperature and Pressure. Each treatment is labeled with the corresponding combination of levels (e.g., '50, Low' or '10, High').\n\n::: {#warning-example1 .callout-warning icon=\"false\"}\n## Example 1\n\nThree groups of students, 5 in each group, were receiving therapy for severe test anxiety. Group 1 received 5 hours, group 2 received 10 hours and group 3 received 15 hours. At the end of therapy each subject completed an evaluation of test anxiety. Did the amount of therapy have an effect on the level of test anxiety?\n\nThe three groups of students received the scores on the Test Anxiety index (TAI) at the end of treatment shown in the table below.\n\n| Group 1 | Group 2 | Group 3 |\n|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|\n|   48    |   55    |   51    |\n|   50    |   52    |   52    |\n|   53    |   53    |   50    |\n|   52    |   55    |   53    |\n|   50    |   53    |   50    |\n\n\\\n:::\n\nWhen faced with a text like this, it is useful to identify the treatment factors, their levels and the treatments, as well the response. Clearly, from the question, we are interested in the effect of therapy on test anxiety. A statement like this can generally be read as the effect of the treatment factor on the response. Nowhere is another treatment factor mentioned, so we only have one in this example. What are the levels of therapy we set? The levels are 5, 10 and 15 hours of therapy and since we only have one factor these are also the treatments. Let's summarise this as follows:\n\n-   **Response:** Test Anxiety\\\n-   **Treatment Factor:** Therapy\\\n-   **Treatment Levels:** 5, 10, and 15 hours of therapy\\\n-   **Treatments:** 5, 10, and 15\n\n## **Experimental and observational unit** {.unnumbered}\n\nThe **experimental unit** is the entity (e.g. material, object, or individual) to which a treatment is assigned or that receives the treatment. By contrast, the **observational unit** is the entity from which the response is recorded. This distinction is very important because it is the experimental units which determine how often the treatment has been replicated and therefore the precision with which we can measure the treatment effect. In the methods that we cover in this course, we require that in the end there is only one ‘observation’ (response value) per experimental unit. If several measurements have been taken on an experimental unit, we will combine these into one observation, typically by taking the mean. Very often, the experimental unit is also the observational unit.\n\nWhat are the experiemental units? To determine this, revisit the text of Example 1 and ask yourself: what entity received the treatments or to what were treatments applied? Most of you, will probably answer the students and this is correct. Each student received the respective treatment (number of hours in therapy) assigned to their group and so there are $5 \\times 3 = 15$ experimental units.\n\nThere is an argument to be made that it is not clear whether the students received therapy on their own or that the groups of students received therapy together. In that case, treatments were applied to groups of students and so there would be three experimental units. This will usually be clear from the text, but we'll use this scenario to illustrate some concepts as we go.\n\nWe also need to know what the observational units are. The text states that at the end of therapy, each student completed an evaluation to determine their level of test anxiety. So the response, test anxiety, was measured on the student level which means students are the observational units. In the first scenario, the students are both the experimental units and observational units. But this would not be the case if groups are the experimental unit.\n\nWe also require that there is only one observation per experimental unit, the first scenario meets this requirement. For the second scenario, we have 5 observations per group and so we would have to take the mean of these values to end up with one response value per group.\n\nLet's add to the summary assuming students are the experimental units:\n\n-   **Experimental unit (no):** Student (15)\\\n-   **Observational unit (no):** Student (15)\n\n## **Homogeneity of experimental units** {.unnumbered}\n\nWhen the set of experimental units are as similar as possible such that there are no distinguishable differences between them, they are said to be **homogeneous** (a fancy word for saying they are of the same kind). The more homogeneous the units are, the smaller the experimental error variance (natural variation between between observations of the same treatments) will be. It is super important to have fairly homogeneous units because it allows us to detect differences between treatments more easily.\n\n## **Blocking** {.unnumbered}\n\nIf the experimental units are not fairly similar but are heterogeneous (the opposite of homogeneous), we can group them into sets of similar units. This process is called **blocking** and the groups are considered \"blocks\". We compare the treatments within each block as if each block is its own mini-experiment. This way we account for the differences between blocks and can better isolate the effect of the treatments.\n\n::: {.callout-warning icon=\"false\"}\n## Example 2.2 EDIT THIS STILL\n\nImagine you’re testing the effectiveness of two marketing strategies (A and B) to increase sales at a chain of coffee shops. The coffee shops are located in different neighborhoods, where factors like income levels might influence sales. To prevent these differences from skewing the results, you group the coffee shops into \"blocks\" based on neighborhood income level (e.g., low, medium, high).\n\nWithin each block, you randomly assign coffee shops to either Strategy A or Strategy B. This approach allows you to compare the strategies while controlling for variability caused by differences in neighborhood income levels.\n\nWithout blocking, would you be able to confidently attribute differences in sales to the strategies alone? Likely not, as any observed differences could be due to neighborhood-specific factors rather than the strategies themselves.\n:::\n\n## **Replication and pseudoreplication** {.unnumbered}\n\nIf a treatment is applied independently to more than one experimental unit it is said to be **replicated**. Treatments must be replicated! Making more than one observation on the same experimental unit is not replication, but *pseudoreplication*. Pseudoreplication is a common fallacy (REF?). The problem is that without true replication, we don’t have an estimate of uncertainty, of how repeatable, or how variable the result is if the same treatment were to be applied repeatedly.\n\nIn Example 1, if experimental units were the groups and we didn't take the average of the observations per group, we would have pseudoreplication as each student would not be an independent replicate of a treatment - effectively, we have only applied each treatment once. You might notice that we then only have one true replicate per treatment group and this is problematic. To get an estimate of uncertainty, we would have to repeat this experiment a few more times to get more than one proper replicate.\n\nThe first scenario, however, did not have this problem and each treatment was replicated five times. After going through all this, we have the following summary:\n\n-   **Response:** Test Anxiety\\\n-   **Treatment Factor:** Therapy\\\n-   **Treatment Levels:** 5, 10, and 15 hours of therapy\\\n-   **Treatments:** 5, 10, and 15\\\n-   **Experimental unit (no):** Student (15)\\\n-   **Observational unit (no):** Student (15)\\\n-   **Replicates:** 5\n\n::: callout-tip\nCreating a summary like this, is a handy exercise for any experiment you come across, and we’ll keep doing it for every experiment in this book. As we go along, we’ll also add information about the type of experiment that was conducted.\n:::\n",
