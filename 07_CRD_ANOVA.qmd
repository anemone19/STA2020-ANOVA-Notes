# Analysis of Variance


Although, I like the following description: 

> "Analysis of variance is better defined as a method of dividing (analysing) a total variance into at least two components...Using a liberal definition of variances, analysis of variance can be said to consist of estimating variances, and possibly of testing hypotheses about them."
