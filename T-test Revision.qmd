This document is a quick revision of t-tests and slightly modified notes of previous lectures. For more notes and practice, see Introstat CH9 pg 208-211.

### Introduction {.unnumbered}

T-test are used to test whether two sample means differ. There are two types of t-tests, an independent t-test or paired t-test. We will only consider the independent t-test, as the one-way anova is an extension of this type. The independent samples t-test is used to compare two randomly chosen independent samples (such control vs experiment), where each sample has different experimental units. Here we are interested in comparing the means of the samples. The test has three assumptions, all which must be checked for validity:

-   Equal population variances
-   Normality of samples
-   Independent random samples

The first two are required so that the distribution of the test statistic holds and the second one is to ensure correct variance estimates. 

EXAMPLE 

INFORMATION WE HAVE 

### Hypothesis Statements {.unnumbered}

-   Null Hypothesis (H₀): $\mu_1 = \mu_2$
-   Alternative Hypotheses:
    -   Upper-tailed: $\mu_1 > \mu_2$
    -   Lower-tailed: $\mu_1 < \mu_2$
    -   Two-sided: $\mu_1 \neq \mu_2$

### Test Statistic  {.unnumbered}

Here is the formula of the test statistic (remember that the test statistic is constructed under the null hypothesis): 

$$t = \frac{(\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2) - (\mu_1 - \mu_2)}{s_p\sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1}+\frac{1}{n_2}}},$$
where the **pooled variance** is: $s_p^2 = \frac{(n_1 -1)S_1^2 + (n_2 -1)S_2^2}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}$

Notice that if the **null hypothesis is true**, the difference between sample means should be **close to zero**. Let's assume our null hypothesis is that the difference between meansis zero, i.e. the population means are the same:

$$ \mu_1 = \mu_2 \Rightarrow |\mu_1 = \mu_2| = 0$$
and if $H_0$ is true, that means: 

$$ |\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2| \approx 0 $$
So if the numerator is small, then the whole fraction will tend to zero: 


$$t^* \rightarrow 0 $$


That means that if we get a small test statistic, we'll likely fail to reject the null hypothesis. On the other hand, if the test statistic is large, we'll likely reject the null hypothesis. 

-   **Small test statistic** → likely **fail to reject H₀**.
-   **Large test statistic** → likely **reject H₀**.


How do we decide what is big enough? To decide this, we need to know what the distribution of our test statistic is under the null hypothesis (that is as if $H_0$) is true. We can then obtain critical values: values of the distributon that above which indicate unlikely test statistic values if the null hypothesis was true. Our test statistic follows a t-distribution which depends on the degrees of freedom.  


**Degrees of freedom (df):**\
    \[ df = (n_1 - 1) + (n_2 - 1) \]

Using **t**\* and **df**, we obtain a **p-value** to draw a conclusion.

Significance Level vs. p-value?

-   **Significance Level (α):** Predefined cut-off, probability of **Type I error**.
-   **p-value:** Probability of obtaining a result **as extreme or more extreme** under H₀.\
-   **Decision Rule:**
    -   If ( p \leq α ), **reject** H₀.
    -   If ( p \> α ), **fail to reject** H₀.

## Example 13C (pg. 211) {.unnumbered}

**Compare two methods of assembling a television component** in terms of **time taken to assemble**.

-   Only adopt **Method B** if its **assembly time** is **significantly shorter** than **Method A** by more than **one minute**.\
-   Carry out hypothesis test at **5% significance level**.

Hypothesis Statements

1.  **H₀:** ( \mu\_A - \mu\_B = 1 ) (Method B is either equal to or not sufficiently shorter than Method A)
2.  **H₁:** ( \mu\_A - \mu\_B \> 1 ) (Method B is significantly shorter by more than 1 minute)

Given Data

| Method | Mean (X̄) | Std Dev (S) | Sample Size (n) |
|--------|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| A      | 7.72     | 0.67        | 17              |
| B      | 6.21     | 0.51        | 25              |

Test Statistic Calculation:

\[ t = \frac{(7.72 - 6.21) - 1}{S_p \sqrt{\frac{1}{17} + \frac{1}{25}}} \]

-   **Pooled variance (Sp):** \[ S_p\^2 = \frac{(17 -1)0.67^2 + (25 -1)0.51^2}{17 + 25 - 2} \]

-   **Degrees of freedom (df):** \[ df = (17 - 1) + (25 - 1) = 40 \]

-   Using **t-table or RStudio**:

    -   **t₄₀ = 2.423**
    -   **p-value = 0.0039**

Conclusion

-   **p-value \< 0.05**, so **reject H₀**.
-   Conclude that at **5% significance level**, **Method B is significantly shorter by more than 1 minute**.
-   **Adopt Method B**.
