    "text": "Preface\nWelcome to the Experimental Design and ANOVA section of STA2020.\nThis book is not an exhaustive guide to designing experiments or conducting ANOVA. Instead, it has been tailored specifically to align with the learning outcomes and methods covered in STA2020.\nThis module consists of four main sections:\n\nExperimental Design\nCompletely Randomized Designs\nRandomized Complete Block Designs\nFactorial Experiments\n\nThe first two chapters lay the groundwork for the module. Once you grasp these concepts, the remaining sections should be easier to follow. Before diving into these topics, there are two preliminary sections:\n\nA brief introduction to statistical modeling\nA guide to hypothesis testing\n\nI encourage you to read through these first, as they provide essential context for the rest of the material.\nThroughout the book, you will find R code presented in chunks like this:\n\nx &lt;- c(1,2,3,4,5)\nmean(x) # Computes the mean of a set of numbers  \n\n[1] 3\n\n\nR is consistently used to visualize, illustrate, and demonstrate key methods and concepts. Running the code yourself will greatly enhance your understanding, so I encourage you to do so.\n\nSome parts of these notes have been adapted from the STA2007 notes, authored by Dr. Res Altwegg and Dr. Birgit Erni, as well as from various textbooks.",
